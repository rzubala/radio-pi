Raspberry Radio: Android application and Node.js REST Server
A simple application which controls the Raspberry Pi radio (run as a Music Player Daemon). The REST server written in Node.js serves as a communication layer between application and the radio. The prototype of the Android native application is written in Kotlin and uses Model-View-ViewModel pattern but the final client version has been created in React-Native.
